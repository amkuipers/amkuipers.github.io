title: Using KISS LoRa board
---

# Story

At the [EA Beurs 2017](www.eabeurs.nl) about 2000 gadgets were distributed. These gadgets are called KISS LORA, 
and were produced live. From a PCB to a soldered and tested gadget. It was interesting to see what all these different 
machines could do in this process. 

For the lucky ones that got a gadget, these had to go to several suppliers to collect additional parts for the gadget,
like a battery, cable. Then an TheThingsNetwork account should be created and then the gadget could be commisioned.

## Commissioning the gadget

At a supplier the battery and usb cable had to be installed, and then, from a phone (using QR code) the commissioning
website could be visited. After the TTN login, a terminal was selected (there were multiple terminals on site), and then
the gadget was commissioned.

That basically means that in your TTN account, a new Application with a new Device was created. Then the gadget would
be registered for OTAA. Unfortunately, the commissioning website kept on spinning, even on the next day when visiting
the same URL. So I had to find out what was finished, and what still had to be configured.

## The source

Fortunately the source of the gadget is available on github.
